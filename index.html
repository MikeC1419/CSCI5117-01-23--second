            <h2>About Justin</h1>
            <p>Justin Joshua Jefferson (born June 16, 1999)[1] is an American football wide receiver for the Minnesota Vikings of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football at LSU and was drafted by the Vikings in the first round of the 2020 NFL Draft.
            Jefferson immediately made an impact upon entering the league, setting a rookie record for receiving yards with 1,400 (a record that was broken in 2021 by his former LSU teammate Ja'Marr Chase), along with being named to the Pro Bowl and an All-Pro in each of his first 3 seasons. In 2022, Jefferson became the youngest player to lead the league in receptions (128), and receiving yards (1,809), amassing the most receiving yards through a player's first 3 seasons.</p>
